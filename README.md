The open source & cross-platform implementation of Microsoft Remote Differential Compression algorithm and tools, 

This program is an alternative of widely used file transferring and synchronizing tool rsync, and I believe it has some advantages over rsync.

* more efficient
* better performance
* commecial friendly license, Apache License 2.0

This program is based on the Microsoft paper:

Optimizing File Replication over Limited-Bandwidth Networks using Remote Differential Compression
